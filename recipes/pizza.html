    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Yogurt</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Mix flour and Greek yogurt together in a bowl to form a dough; transfer to a work surface floured with self-rising flour. Knead dough, adding more flour as needed to keep dough from being too sticky, about 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Spray a 12-inch pizza pan with cooking spray and spread dough to the edges of the pan. </li>
            <li>Bake pizza crust in preheated oven for 5 to 7 minutes; add your favorite toppings and return to the preheated oven. Bake until crust is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes more. </li>
            <li>Enjoy like Hasbulla does</li>
        </ol>
